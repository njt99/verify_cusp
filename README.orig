This directory contains the verify program, the data used by
the program to rule out the entire parameter space, less the seven exceptional
regions, and the output which was produced by the program as it was run.
The data is interpreted using the conditionlist file, which is also here.

The data is in the data subdirectory, and the output is in the
output subdirectory, while the program itself is in this directory,
in three versions.  The original source is a CWEB program, with filenames
ending in .w and .format:
	ACJ.w Codes.w Complex.w SL2ACJ.w glue.w roundoff.w verify.w
	verify.format
This source was tangled to produce C++ code, with filenames ending in .C,
.h, and .inline:
	ACJ.C Codes.C Complex.C SL2ACJ.C verify.C
	ACJ.h Codes.h Complex.h SL2ACJ.h roundoff.h
	ACJ.inline Complex.inline
Finally, the source was weaved to produce a TeX document:
	verify.tex, verify.idx, and verify.scn.
This TeX document needs cwebmac.tex, which is also provided here.

The verify program assumes the machines compute identical values for
pow(2^i/6), for i=0,1,2,3,4,5.  The test_float.C program, also provided,
prints these values, and also tests the underflow-detecting code.

In addition, there is this README file, a Makefile, and the conditionlist.

For further documentation, please read verify.tex, and the paper which is in
../../paper.
